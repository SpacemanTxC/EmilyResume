          About Me:
          Hi, my name is Emily Capra. I am a veterinary assistant currently
          working option, my LVT(Lisenced Veterinary Technition).I have been in
          the veterinary field for over two years. Working with animals brings me great joy,
          knowing I am able to assist in keeping pets healthy, and nursing those that are sick.
          I have had these passions since I was a child and look forward in growing my knowledge and skills.
